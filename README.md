# CADD-Format-Conversion
This Python script allows users to convert SMILES Strings in an CSV file and combine them into one SDF Output File. The conversion can be done using two tools: RDKit and OpenBabel. 
Sample results: result_7.sdf and result_9.sdf are output files converted by OpenBabel and RDKit, respectively; result_8 is the RDKit's converted file without creating 3D space by using AllChem's EmbedMolecule and UFFOptimizeMolecule. 

The CSV Dataset used for the conversion is downloaded from this site: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yanmaksi/big-molecules-smiles-dataset
